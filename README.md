# JwlmergePwa

This project is based on [JWLMerge](https://github.com/AntonyCorbett/JWLMerge) and is ported using [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/) and [jszip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip).
All loading and merging is done in the browser without any need for a backend. It will be also installable as a Progressive Web App (pwa). So offline win/mac/linux/android/ios is covered too. There is still some way to go to finish it.

There you go to the app:

 Still heavy work in progress!!
